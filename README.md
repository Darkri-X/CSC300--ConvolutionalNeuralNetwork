Assessment Criteria and Rubric
This assessment is about data manipulation, preparing pictures to be trained by a convolutional neural network model and, train a CNN model using also transfer learning. 

The criteria are clearly defined on this page, in the grading section.


## Task Instructions

### Uncompress dataset to:

1. Read the dataset images.
2. Transform them accordingly in preparation for modelling.
3. Do image classification on the test dataset.
4. Among many parameters, hyperparameters, and data preparation steps you can do to use with CNN, 
   1. explain why you took the approach "A" instead of "B".
5. Your goal ultimately is to classify an image between 5 possible classes using a CNN model.

> **Note**: This dataset is anonymised, having 500 samples of 5 classes, totalling 2500 image files.

Reasoning is not a description of the code, as the code should be readable by default. Reasoning is explaining the thought process and why you achieve a certain outcome, things you could try to get better, etc.

You cannot use libraries not taught during the course for this assignment. This will result in forfeiting (from marking perspective) the section of the code with such libraries.


## Resources
The Modules 06,07,11,12 provides enough resources to get you a reasonably good model (accuracy between 30-50%). 

> **Note:** For a higher accuracy model you will need to research yourself on how to optimize and fine-tune the model.
